Can download any Konect network, save to `Compressed_Networks`, and run ``extractDataset.sh`` in the main project dir, giving it the name from the file downloaded, e.g. arenas-jazz

in `src` is a small example script you can run (from within src dir) with
``python main.py <network_name>``

TODO upgrade extractDataset.sh to directly download network
TODO rework main.py to not use relative paths
